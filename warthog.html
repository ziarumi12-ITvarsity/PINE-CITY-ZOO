        <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
        <p>Their scientific name is Phacochoerus Africanus also known as the common warthog. ... Warthogs mainly eat grass or will dig for roots and bulbs when it's dry. If they have the opportunity, they will scavenge on meat as they are omnivorous. They like to roll in the mud to protect their skin from the sun and from parasites/p>
