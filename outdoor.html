        <h3>OUTDOOR RESTAURANT</h3>
        <p>When the sun is out in Joburg, where better to enjoy lunch than in a sunny garden or courtyard, especially if you follow the mantra that in times of Covid it is always better to sit outside.

Most Joburg restaurants have at least an open street terrace - sometimes little more than an open-window counter or more often a large outdoor area looking onto an uninspiring shopping mall car park. Here we have focused on highlighting charming courtyards and hidden gardens, pool decks, rooftops, beer gardens and other hidden places where the outside space is something special.</p>
